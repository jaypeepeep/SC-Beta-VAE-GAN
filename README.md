# SC-β-VAE-GAN: Shift-Correction VAE-GAN for Handwriting Augmentation

SC-β-VAE-GAN is a **Python web application** designed for **augmenting and imputing handwriting time series data** using a **Shift-Correction Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network (SC-β-VAE-GAN)**.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions  
To set up the SC-β-VAE-GAN Web Application locally, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jaypeepeep/SC-Beta-VAE-GAN.git
cd SC-Beta-VAE-GAN
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies  
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the application  
```sh
python Main.py
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
### **Back-End & Machine Learning**  
- **Python**  
- **Flask** (for API & backend handling)  
- **PyQt** (for GUI)  
- **Jupyter** (for model training)  
- **TensorFlow & Keras** (for deep learning)  
- **Pandas & Matplotlib** (for data processing & visualization)  

### **Front-End**  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (for the handwriting canvas interface)  

### **Suggested Hardware**  
- A **pen tablet** for better handwriting input, as the application is designed for precise stroke recording.  

## 📌 Features  
- **Handwriting Augmentation:** Generates synthetic handwriting samples.  
- **Time-Series Data Imputation:** Fills in missing handwriting strokes.  
- **Shift Correction:** Corrects misaligned handwriting patterns.
